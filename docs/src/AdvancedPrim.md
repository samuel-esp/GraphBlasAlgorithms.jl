# Advanced Prim

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*In computer science, Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.*

function stoppingCondition(m, n)

*computes the stop condition. Takes the matrix m and the number of nodes, returns a boolean*

function prim(A, n)

*computes the miniminum spanning tree cost and tracks the minimum spanning tree. Takes the matrix A and the number of nodes, returns the cost of the minimum spanning tree and the spanning tree itself*
