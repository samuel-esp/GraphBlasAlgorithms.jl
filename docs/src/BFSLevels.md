# BFS Levels

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level*

***

function bfs_level(A, s, n)

*computes the levels of the tree starting from a source node. Takes the matrix A, the source node s and the number of nodes n*
