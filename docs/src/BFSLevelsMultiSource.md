# BFS Levels Multi Source 

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level*

***

function ms_bfs(A, S, n, s)

*computes the levels of the tree starting from multiple source nodes. Takes A as the input matrix, S as the sources matrix, n is the number of nodes, s is the number of sources in the matrix S, Output: Levels matrix*
