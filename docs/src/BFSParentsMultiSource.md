# BFS Parents Multi Source

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level*

***

function bfs_parents(A, S, n, s)

*computes the parents starting from multiple source nodes. Takes A as the input matrix, S as the source nodes, n is the number of nodes, s is the number of sources, Output: Parents matrix*
