# Floyd Warshall

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*n computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm (also known as Floyd's algorithm, the Roy–Warshall algorithm, the Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles)*

function floydwarshall(A, n)

*computes the floyd warshall algorithm. Takes A as the input matrix, n as the number of nodes. Returns the shortest path matrix for each node*
