# GraphBlasAlgorithms

*the following repository relates to the project of the Parallel and Distributed Computing course [IN480] of the Roma Tre University carried out by Samuel Esposito and Claudio Vona. The project contains a series of graph algorithms designed in Julia following a typical linear algebra approach. The libraries used within the project are: SuiteSparseGraphBlas.jl, DataStructures.jl, LinearAlgebra.jl*
